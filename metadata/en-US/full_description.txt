Keep Screen On allows you to add a quick settings tile, with which you can easily disable screen timeout and then restore the previous timeout value.

For example, this may be useful to you if you need the display to stay on temporarily when viewing a website or document or if your device does not have the option to set the screen timeout to never in the settings.
